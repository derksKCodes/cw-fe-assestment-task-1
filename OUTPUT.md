## Changes Made

---

### Header

1. Padding inconsistency
   - Issue: Used `px-6 py-4`, inconsistent with design spacing.
   - Fix: Updated to `px-8 py-3` for consistency.

2. Border color inconsistency
   - Issue: Used `border-gray-800`, did not match app palette.
   - Fix: Updated to `border-gray-500`.

3. Logo responsiveness
   - Issue: Logo used `w-10 h-10` without responsiveness.
   - Fix: Changed to `w-5 h-5 md:w-6 md:h-6` for responsive sizing.

4. Title semantic and styling
   - Issue: Wrapped title in `<div>` without semantic styling.
   - Fix: Changed to `<span>` with `text-white font-bold text-lg md:text-xl tracking-tight`.

5. Unnecessary inline styles
   - Issue: Used `style={{ position: "relative" }}`.
   - Fix: Replaced with Tailwind `relative` utility.

6. Search bar accessibility and structure
   - Issue: Nested `<span>` wrappers, no ARIA roles.
   - Fix: Replaced with clean structure using `role="search"` and `aria-label="Search in header"`.

7. Focus ring visibility
   - Issue: Used `focus:ring-0`, making focus invisible.
   - Fix: Replaced with `focus:outline-none focus:ring-2 focus:ring-blue-500`.

8. Placeholder, padding, and rounding inconsistency
   - Issue: Used `rounded-full`, `pl-9`, no consistent placeholder styling.
   - Fix: Updated to `rounded-lg`, `pl-13`, added `py-6`, `md:text-md`, and placeholder styling.

9. Avatar responsiveness
   - Issue: Inline sizing `style={{ width: "32px", height: "32px" }}`.
   - Fix: Updated to `className="w-10 h-10 md:w-[54px] md:h-[54px] mr-3"`.
