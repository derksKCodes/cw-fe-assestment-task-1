## Changes Made

---

### Project Structure

1. Component modularization for clarity and reusability  
   - **Issue:** Previously, search, header, hero section, and tag list logic were mixed within `App.tsx`, making it harder to navigate and maintain.  
   - **Fix:** Created dedicated, reusable, and clearly named component files:  
     1. `BoxArea97.tsx` – hero section with background and search.  
     2. `BoxArea108.tsx` – search bar component.  
     3. `Header.tsx` – top navigation with search and avatar.  
     4. `TagList.tsx` – reusable tag display section.  
   - Imported these cleanly in `App.tsx` to improve readability and scalability.

### App.tsx

1. Clean structured layout  
   - **Issue:** Previously cluttered with logic and layout in one place.  
   - **Fix:** Now imports and utilizes:  
     1. `<Header />`  
     2. `<BoxArea97 />`  
     3. `<TagList />`  
     for a clean, readable structure.

2. State management for tags  
   - **Issue:** Hardcoded, scattered tags.  
   - **Fix:** Centralized tags in state using `useState`, allowing easier future expansion.

3. Consistent styling  
   - **Issue:** Inconsistent background and text styling.  
   - **Fix:** Added `className="bg-[#121417] min-h-screen text-white"` for consistent dark theme and full-screen layout.

---

### Header

1. Consistent background  
   - **Issue:** Previously using inconsistent background colors.  
   - **Fix:** Updated to `bg-[#121417]` matching the overall app background.

2. Responsive logo sizing  
   - **Issue:** Non-responsive logo.  
   - **Fix:** Updated to `w-5 h-5 md:w-6 md:h-6`.

3. Accessible and structured search bar  
   - **Issue:** Previously lacked semantic structure.  
   - **Fix:** Added `role="search"` and `aria-label="Search in header"` for accessibility.

4. Focus ring and placeholder consistency  
   - **Issue:** Invisible focus ring and inconsistent placeholder styles.  
   - **Fix:** Updated to `focus:outline-none focus:ring-2 focus:ring-blue-500` with consistent `py-6` and placeholder styling.

5. Responsive avatar  
   - **Issue:** Non-responsive, inline styling.  
   - **Fix:** Updated to `className="w-10 h-10 md:w-[54px] md:h-[54px] mr-3"` for consistent responsive sizing.

---

### BoxArea97

1. Props-based search handling  
   - **Issue:** Previously hardcoded search handling within the hero section.  
   - **Fix:** Accepts `initialValue` and `onSearch` as props for flexibility.

2. Semantic and accessible section  
   - **Issue:** Lacked `aria-label`.  
   - **Fix:** Added `aria-label="Search section"` for accessibility.

3. Clean centered hero section structure  
   - **Issue:** Messy padding and inconsistent alignment.  
   - **Fix:** Uses `flex flex-col items-center justify-center text-center px-[94px]` for clear structure.

4. Consistent heading  
   - **Issue:** Inconsistent heading styles.  
   - **Fix:** Uses `text-3xl md:text-5xl font-black text-white tracking-tight`.

---

### BoxArea108

1. Proper TypeScript prop typing  
   - **Issue:** Previously lacked consistent props typing.  
   - **Fix:** Added:  
     ```ts
     interface BoxArea108Props { initialValue: string; onSearch: (search: string) => void; }
     ```

2. Search propagation  
   - **Issue:** The Search button did not trigger a search explicitly.  
   - **Fix:** Updated onChange to call `onSearch` directly, and the button now visually signals search but can be extended to call `onSearch(innerValue)` explicitly.

3. Container styling consistency  
   - **Issue:** Inconsistent dark mode styling and rounded corners.  
   - **Fix:** Uses `flex items-center w-full max-w-md mt-6 px-4 py-2 bg-[#1C2126] rounded-lg shadow-lg` for consistency.

4. Accessible and clean input design  
   - **Issue:** Previously missing clear focus styling and placeholder styling.  
   - **Fix:** Updated with `bg-transparent border-none text-white placeholder:text-gray-400 focus:outline-none focus:ring-0 focus-visible:ring-0`.

5. Responsive, accessible search icon  
   - **Issue:** Non-semantic and inconsistent icon sizing.  
   - **Fix:** Uses `className="text-gray-400 w-5 h-5"`.

6. Clickable, consistent search button  
   - **Issue:** Inconsistent button styling.  
   - **Fix:** Updated to `ml-4 bg-blue-500 hover:bg-blue-600 text-white cursor-pointer`.

---

### TagList

1. Added keyboard accessibility for tags  
   - **Issue:** Tags were not keyboard accessible.  
   - **Fix:** Added `tabIndex={0}` and `onKeyDown={handleKeyDown}` enabling Enter/Space activation for accessibility.

2. Optional onTagClick prop for interactivity  
   - **Issue:** Tags were static and non-interactive.  
   - **Fix:** Added `onTagClick` prop to allow parent components to handle tag clicks dynamically.

3. Consistent badge styling  
   - **Issue:** Inconsistent colors and sizing.  
   - **Fix:** Uses `bg-[#293038] md:text-lg text-gray-400 hover:bg-gray-700 py-1.5 px-4 rounded focus:ring-2 focus:ring-blue-500` for visual consistency and accessibility.

4. Structured semantic section  
   - **Issue:** Lacked clarity and semantic labeling.  
   - **Fix:** Added `aria-label={title}` for screen reader clarity.

### useIsMobile Hook

1. SSR safety and hydration consistency  
   - Issue: Using `window` directly can throw errors during SSR, and initializing `isMobile` with `undefined` can cause hydration mismatches in Next.js and React 19.  
   - Fix: Added a safe initialization:  
     ```ts
     const [isMobile, setIsMobile] = React.useState<boolean>(() => {
       if (typeof window !== "undefined") {
         return window.innerWidth < MOBILE_BREAKPOINT;
       }
       return false;
     });
     ```
2. Using `mql.matches` instead of `window.innerWidth`  
   - Issue: Mixing `window.innerWidth` and `matchMedia` adds inconsistency and redundancy.  
   - Fix: Replaced with:  
     ```ts
     setIsMobile(mql.matches);
     ```

3. Safari < 14 compatibility  
   - Issue: Older Safari versions do not support `mql.addEventListener`.  
   - Fix: Added fallback using:  
     ```ts
     if (mql.addEventListener) {
       mql.addEventListener("change", onChange);
     } else {
       mql.addListener(onChange);
     }
     ```

4. Added cleanup with browser compatibility  
   - Issue: Cleanup only using `removeEventListener` may fail on older browsers.  
   - Fix: Matching fallback in cleanup:  
     ```ts
     if (mql.removeEventListener) {
       mql.removeEventListener("change", onChange);
     } else {
       mql.removeListener(onChange);
     }
     ```
